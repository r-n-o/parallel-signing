# Parallel signing

Mini web-app to benchmark parallel signing with Turnkey.

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- An organization ID
- A public/private API key pair for a root Turnkey user (or a user with signing permission)
- A wallet with an account and an address to sign with

### 3/ Running the app

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This command will run a NextJS app on port 3000. Navigate to http://localhost:3000.
